/**
 Actions are atomic units that drive all the other actors: the dispatcher fires actions and the workers execute their tasks when receiving their associated actions. Middleware is called before and after each action is executed by workers and can be used to redirect, defer or bulk-handling failures.
 Any class, struct or enum can implement the `Action` protocol as long as it has a unique name used to identify it. However, most of the time we define actions in an enum:

 ```
 enum GatekeeperAction: Action, Equatable {
     case login(email: String, password: String)
     case logout
     case resetPassword

     enum Name: Equatable {
         case login
         case logout
         case resetPassword
     }

     var name: Name {
         switch self {
         case .login: return .login
         case .logout: return .logout
         case .resetPassword: return .resetPassword
         }
     }
 }
 ```

public protocol Action {
    associatedtype Name: Hashable
    
    /// The action name
    var name: Name { get }
}

/**
 Type-erasure for `Action`s
 */

    public typealias Name = AnyHashable

    public let wrappedValue: Any
    public let name: Name
    public init<A: Action>(_ action: A) {
        if let anyAction = action as? AnyAction {
            self = anyAction
        }
        else {
            self.wrappedValue = action
            name = AnyHashable(action.name)
        }
    }
}

public extension Action {
    /// Used to chain multiple actions one after the other
    func then(other: Self) -> ActionFlow<Self> {
        ActionFlow(actions: [self, other])
    }

/**

    /// All the actions in this flow in the execution order.
    let actions: [A]

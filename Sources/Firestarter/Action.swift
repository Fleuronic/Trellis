/**
 Actions are atomic units that drive all the other actors: the dispatcher fires them while the workers execute action-associated tasks as a result. Middleware is called before and after each action is processed and can be used to redirect the action or for handling all failures in one place.
 Any class, struct or enum can implement the `Action` protocol. However, most of the time we define actions in an enum:
 ```
 enum GatekeeperAction: Action, Equatable {
     case login(email: String, password: String)
     case logout
     case resetPassword
 }
 ```
